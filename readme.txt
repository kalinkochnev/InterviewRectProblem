The problem was solved assuming that:
    1. Rectangles will not be angled or skewed
    2. The numbers entered for rectangle coordinates and lengths are real numbers and not imaginary
    3. If a large rectangle contains a smaller rectangle, they are contained
    4. If a smaller rectangle is inside a larger rectangle, they are contained
    5. If a two rectangles have the same coordinates/properties, they are contained
    6. Two rectangles are not adjacent if two sides meet at a polygon vertex
